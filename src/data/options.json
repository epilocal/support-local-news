Southeast Ohio and the Mid-Ohio Valley region of West Virginia is often ignored or isolated. It's a converative, aging region with little growth. As such, many residents - particularly young professionals - do not think of this region as one of opportunity. Since launching our publication, we've found (through interviews and surveys) that our content has contributed directly to an increase in community pride. Anecdotally, we've heard from residents who chose to visit, move to, or start a business in our region because our content has given them a more positive perception on our region. Our mission is to show residents that there is a lot of opportunity here in the MOV and that the MOV is just as deserving of good things. In doing so, we hope to contribute to things like - increased student retetion at local colleges, increased business occupancy in our downtowns, increased retention of young professionals, and increased investment in our communities. While we do not have hard data to support these impacts, we have relationships with community leaders who believe we are a contributing factor to all of the above. That is why we do what we do.",
                    "Summary": "Clutch MOV is a free, online publication that delivers creative coverage of the Mid-Ohio Valley’s rich culture and local flavor through the eyes of young professionals. We exist to bring light to our communities’ hidden gems, offer a fresh perspective on old favorites, uplift local people, places, and events, and publish positive, current content each week for our readers."

In 2019, National Grid Gas Company started refusing to hook up gas lines for multiple small businesses in North Brooklyn due to a legislative loophole. Bushwick Daily broke the story with an article covering the gas shut-off and featuring several local business owners unable to operate because of the shutdown. The original reporting published by Bushwick Daily was seen by local city officials, larger publications and other local business owners allowing them to put pressure on the gas company to provide service to the businesses which they eventually did. Last year there was a spike in ICE raids in our coverage area. We covered the raids and published news-to-use stories on how to protect yourself if ICE shows up at your door, along with info on the ongoing raids and how our local elected officials were responding to the activity. Bushwick Daily also covers positive community news on black and POC businesses. An example of this is Ethel’s Club, the first exclusively POC private membership and workspace club to open in Brooklyn. Bushwick Daily published an exclusive interview with the owner and information on how the community could support the organization and get involved.",
                    "Summary": "Bushwick Daily is an independent media company based in New York City that launched in 2009 to focus on community issues, events, food, art, and culture in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick.\nThe publication is a progressive local resource for the thriving communities of Bushwick, Ridgewood, and East Williamsburg. Five days a week, Bushwick Daily publishes articles from a diverse team of local contributors about neighborhood events and hyperlocal news."

We’re so thankful you’re reading this, because that means like us, you’ve been seeking consistent food and drink coverage you can trust. Sure, there are options out there. But good food coverage takes experience, and is expensive. Some publications can’t afford it; others let paychecks or page views determine what places get good coverage. Neither benefits the reader — so we’re doing things differently."

But the longer-term expansion of its core mission came with the founding of the Somerville News Garden project in 2019 in response to the rolling collapse of the local news industry. BINJ's mission was further expanded by its legislative work on a key bill aimed at getting a journalism commission established by the state legislature.",

BINJ achieves its mission by: providing organizational support to community publications; running reporting collaborations and civic engagement initiatives; training promising journalists; and producing bold independent journalism. Best known for its investigative reporting, BINJ launched the Somerville News Garden project in 2019 to experiment with creating a replicable volunteer-driven model that municipalities can use to reverse their slide toward becoming news deserts."

I was able to cover the story, contact local people in the area, run photos of the car. When the young man's family saw the car and all the local coverage, he turned himself in at 2:00 am. I was able to cover that as well. By 3:00 am I had covered the entire incident while other news organizations had not. I have also been very successful with the return of lost pets and personalizing local restaurant owners with the general populace. For example, when one person who is a local influencer complained about service at a local restaurant, I was able to inform the influencer and the public that the owner had lost her only son to cancer 3 days earlier, resolving the situation.",

We forced legacy news organizations to start producing news stories at the increased pace of digital to keep up with us, and our reporting has provided people with a window on the inner workings of all three branches of government. Public service journalism has always been our goal, and last year - as measles outbreaks were popping up around the country for the first time in 25 years - we pushed the Connecticut Department of Public Health into releasing school-level vaccination data for the first time by highlighting the law preventing the data's release. The release of the data showed a shocking number of schools below the CDC's recommended immunization rate of 95%, and an increasing trend of parents using a religious exemption to avoid vaccinating their children despite the lack of any underlying health issue preventing them from being vaccinated. The legislature took notice and then took action, and began working toward a number of initiatives to improve vaccination rates. The series of news stories, which won both a LION Publishers award as well as the Public Service Journalism award from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists. More importantly, the coverage opened the conversation about personal responsibility within the context of public health and, almost as though it was foreshadowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the coverage positioned us as a go-to source of information for the arrival of a disease far more deadly than measles.",

Our state is rural by nature, we have bridged the gap of very small communities to their larger cities/towns to help with resources and more. We also provide the most indepth government and political coverage in our region., In just over 6 years we've become the most-read news source in southwest Wyoming. We have been able to connect small communities whose newspapers closed, or who did not have access to regional news prior. We have become a go-to business for many resources other than news and also were a big part of championing small business during COVID-19",

We take pride in being locally-owned in a day when most newspapers are being bought out by the largest publishing companies in the world."

Our investigative work in federal court led judges to sentence individuals swept up in a 2016 drug sting to time served rather than years behind bars as federal prosecutors wanted. Our work has led to changed state laws in the areas of disclosure for lobbyists and state lawmakers. State lawmakers have repeatedly championed issues after we've written about them, including the state's lax approach to collecting racial/ethnic data in the state criminal justice system. .",

                    "Real-World Impacts": "We strive to provide news not deeply covered by the mainstream media with a focus on underserved communities, and increasingly, solutions-oriented coverage. We've tipped elections with our endorsements, run corrupt public officials out office, restored voting access, exposed practices that prey on the poor and just last week were the first in our state to cover the shortage of reagents limiting COVID-19 testing capabilities. \nWe have been on the forefront of Omaha's cultural explosion over the last 25 years. We're a leader in our city and state in collaborative coverage, not only with El Perico (we own), but also the local Hispanic and Black press, community radio, journalism start-ups and local TV.\nAfter 26 years, where to start? Our collaborative journalism leadership has had a direct impact on progressive change in our community in a multitude of ways. One prime example is the time we helped facilitate a Brown-Black alliance to fight a draconian closing of polling places ahead of the 2012 election. Our investigative reporting and data analysis, shared with the local ABC affiliate, helped these communities fight to restore more than a 1/2 of polling places that were to be closed. From beating the New York Times and The Economist on the multi-path appeals-court tactics of local immigration ordinances driven by nativist Kris Kobach, to tipping the balance in elections to stop a nativist mayor, to highlighting inequities in the justice system that allow companies to exploit debts of the poor built on ProPublica coverage, we have been instrumental to building a progressive dialogue in our community. \nPrior to the pandemic, having brought the Solutions Journalism Network to introduce solutions journalism to media ranging from community and rural radio, to the daily newspaper and local network affiliates, we were poised to work with local foundations to bring Impact Media Funders to Omaha to help build a framework for local, diverse media support, built around progressive issues-focused coverage. \nWe have worked closely over the years to cover and provide offline support to the efforts of community organizing groups like the Heartland Workers Center to help drive double digit increases in voter engagement in targeted Black and Hispanic precincts. With hundreds of job fairs under our belt, thousands of local HR contacts and tens of thousands of registered job-seekers on OmahaJobs.com, we’re best positioned to bring new skills and to help transform the local economy with an empowered workforce.",
                    "Summary": "The Reader is Nebraska’s only nationally-recognized alternative newsmonthly, part of the Pioneer Publishing family which also includes El Perico and OmahaJobs.com. Pioneer Publishing is a private, family-held business consisting of 6 media channels — two print, four online — with an established market share in Omaha’s fastest-growing and active demographic and advertising segments and one of the most established, local freelance content provider networks."
